# Chronic Renal Disease Prediction using Machine Learning🩺🔮

# Project Motto✔️
This project aims to develop a chronic kidney disease prediction model to predict whether the given patient is positive or negative for the disease based on training from the given dataset.

# Dataset📄
This dataset was used from kaggle.

# Classification Models Used📈
1. Logistic Regression
2. Naive Bayes
3. KNN
4. Random Forest
5. Decision Tree

# Abstract👨🏻‍💻
In today's era everyone is trying to be conscious about health even through the workload and busy schedule, one gives attention to the health when it shows any symptoms of some kind. In order to that, the field of biosciences have advanced to a larger extent and have generated large amounts of information from Electronic Health Records. This have given rise to the acute need of knowledge generation from this enormous amount of data. Data mining methods and machine learning play a major role in this aspect of biosciences. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged and cannot filter blood as they always do. A family history of kidney diseases or failure, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes may lead to CKD. This is a lasting damage to the kidney and chances of getting worse by time is high. The very common complications that results due to a kidney failure are heart diseases, anaemia, bone diseases, high potassium and calcium. The worst case situation leads to complete kidney failure and necessitates kidney transplant to live. An early detection of CKD can improve the quality of life to a greater extent. This calls for good prediction algorithms to predict CKD at an earlier stage. A wide range of machine learning algorithms are employed for the prediction of CKD. The techniques which will be used here are data pre-processing, exploratory analysis of data, model optimization, various classifiers to predict CKD, and finally the best classifier will be chosen, which can predict CKD in a very early stage.
